# Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) Systems

## Project Overview
This project provides a practical and conceptual understanding of Security Information and Event Management (SIEM) systems used in Security Operations Centers (SOC). The project focuses on log collection, normalization, correlation, alerting, and incident visibility without performing any active exploitation.

## Objective
- Understand how SIEM platforms centralize security logs
- Learn how security alerts are generated using correlation rules
- Simulate SOC analyst (L1) responsibilities such as alert triage
- Map real-world security events to MITRE ATT&CK techniques

## Tools & Concepts Covered
- SIEM Architecture (Splunk-style)
- Log Sources: Firewall, Windows, Web Server
- Correlation Rules & Alerts
- SOC Alert Triage Workflow
- Incident Prioritization

## Diagrams Included
- Enterprise SIEM Architecture
- Log Collection & Normalization Flow
- SOC Alert → Triage → Escalation Workflow

## Outcome
This project helped build a strong foundation in SOC operations, threat detection, and enterprise security monitoring aligned with real-world industry practices.
